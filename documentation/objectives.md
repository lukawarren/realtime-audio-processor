objectives:
- the user must be able to create a collection of audio files, known as a "playlist"
- the user must be able to load this "playlist" and then play the audio files contained within in a logical order
- the user must be able to visualise the current audio being played in the frequency domain (i.e. visualise the frequencies)
- the user must be able to modify the audio's frequency domain (i.e. selectively modify frequencies) in realtime
- the user must be able to apply additional "audio effects" to further enhance the music: echo, reverb, volume adjustment and noise
- the user must be able to configure these "audio effects" individually and also apply pre-made "presets" to quickly reach a desired effect
